          In Model UN, the resolution paper is the cumulative result of all a delegate’s research, debate, discussion,
          and diplomacy. Created by the different blocs which emerge through debate, the resolution paper is the
          written evidence of the solutions produced throughout previous committee sessions. The paper is required
          to be written in a formal context, showing what the various delegates have agreed to do to enact real
          change in the world. In this guide you can find the structure of a resolution paper as well as key terms for
          writing the paper. We wish you the best of luck in creating comprehensive and realistic solutions!
        </p>
        <h5>What is a Resolution Paper?</h5>
        <p>
          A resolution paper is the ultimate goal of a committee. It summarizes the delegates’ ideas, critical thinking,
          diplomacy, and problem-solving skills. Writing a resolution paper is very important because it shows the
          delegate’s ability to translate ideas presented in the committee sessions into workable solutions. Delegates
          should follow a few general guidelines when approaching the resolution paper process. In some cases,
          committees are permitted to implement measures that others would not be able to. For instance, the United
          Nations Security Council (UNSC) may send United Nations (UN) troops, whereas the Disarmament and
          International Security Committee (DISEC) may only recommend UNSC to do so.
          <br><br>
          Before voting on a resolution paper, the paper undergoes rather a lengthy process. As the debate
          progresses, delegates may find their ideas aligning with those of others. When this occurs, delegates are
          free to form blocs, which are groups of countries with similar goals and perspectives on the issue. While it is
          not mandatory to be in a bloc, it is recommended that delegates communicate their ideas and solutions to
          others. There are a few naming conventions for a different parts of the resolution writing process. Typically,
          delegates refer to a Cluster of Ideas when referring to potential solutions compiled into a list. When the
          Cluster of Ideas begins to develop, it is called a Working Paper, a document that has not yet been submitted
          and approved by the Dais.
          <br><br>
          On the Working Paper, there should be a heading, titled “Working Paper,” accompanied by a number (e.g.
          1.1). Next, the name of the committee and the topic follow – in that order. The paper should also include
          Sponsors. They are the main contributors of the paper who guide the paper through the resolution paper
          process; additionally, they participate in the Author’s Panel, a group of presenters of the paper. Typically a
          committee has at most 5 sponsors. Following the Sponsors, the paper requires Signatories, who may agree
          or disagree with the content of the paper, but wish to see its contents discussed either way. A paper requires
          the signatures of at least one third of the committee. It should be noted that the countries in the Sponsors
          and Signatories sections should be listed in alphabetical order.
          <br><br>
          The paper then consists of Preambulatory Clauses. These are clauses that state the issues the committee
          wants to solve and provide an overview of the problem and a summary of past actions. Usually, the United
          Nations Charter is referred to, as well as various resolutions, documents, treaties, references to statistics, and
          past statements by authorities. Verbs in Preambulatory Clauses are italicized – keep in mind that they cannot
          be amended. In addition, each clause ends with a comma.
          <br><br>
          The Preambulatory Clauses are followed by the full name of the committee and a comma, leading into
          the Operative Clauses. The Operative Clauses are the main substance of a paper, outlining the actions the
          committee desires to take to solve the issue. Each clause has one idea, which can be followed by sub-clauses
          describing the idea in detail. Every Operative Clause is numbered and every Operative Phrase – the verb that
          begins each clause – is underlined. Each Operative Clause ends with a semicolon, with exception to the last
          clause, which ends with a period and usually declares that the committee remains seized (decided) with the
          solution to the issue at hand.
          <br><br>
          After the Working Paper is presented to the Dais, it undergoes a process of editing and suggestions. The Dais
          will provide constructive feedback, suggest structural changes, and format any errors through this process
          until it deems the paper presentable. Once approved, the Working Paper is from then on referred to as a Draft
          Resolution. As the Rules of Procedure carry on, with amendments approved or disapproved and questions
          asked, the Draft Resolution reaches the voting stage and the doors are barred. If it passes, the goal of the
          committee is fulfilled and the paper is ultimately called the Resolution Paper. In the event a Draft Resolution
          does not pass, the committee will revert to the Secondary Speakers List.
