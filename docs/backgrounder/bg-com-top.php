        <h2>Letter from the Director</h2>
        <p>
          Dear Delegates,
            <br><br>
            My name is Emily Ni, and it is my utmost pleasure to welcome you to the Disarmament and International Security Committee (DISEC) at PacificMUN 2019.
            <br><br>
            Ever since my first experience three years ago in a General Assembly, I’ve been enamoured with the passionate discourse found uniquely within Model UN. I can say with absolute conviction that the people you meet, the topics in which you gain immense amounts of knowledge, and the skills that you develop as a collaborator, public speaker, and delegate, are invaluable to you. I can only hope to instill the same passion in you, the delegate, as my directors did for me.
            <br><br>
            Serving as your two Chairs are Steven Long and Rhéa Tabet. Steven is currently a grade 11 student at St. George’s school, and is looking forward to making PacificMUN a memorable experience for all. Rhéa is ecstatic to be serving as your Chair at PacificMUN 2019, and is currently a grade 11 student at École Secondaire Jules Verne.
            <br><br>
            Maintaining international peace and security are DISEC’s ultimate goals. Therefore, delegates must work to draft comprehensive resolutions that maintain global stability. Both our topics are incredibly expansive topics that require thorough research and knowledge to allow for constructive debate. Therefore, I would like to stress the importance of gaining an extensive understanding of your country’s stance and relationship with the topics at hand in order to allow for an engaging experience; your work as a delegate will not only benefit yourself, but the committee as a whole.
            <br><br>
            The entire dais team welcomes you to the Disarmament and International Security Committee at PacificMUN 2019. Please do not hesitate to contact us if you have any questions or concerns; we look forward to a weekend of rewarding debate.
            <br><br>
            Sincerely,
            <br>
            Emily Ni <br>
            Director of DISEC <br>
