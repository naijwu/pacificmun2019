        <h3>Greetings Delegates,</h3>
        <p>
          My name is Kevin Roe and along with Jason Fan, Parker Johnston, Joanne Chang, and Geneviève Dubuc, the amazing crisis staff, we have the great honour to be the dais in the Historical Joint Crisis Committee for the first iteration of Canadian Youth Debate Council Model United Nations. As the Crisis Overlord of the Historic Joint Crisis Committee, I hope that the backgrounder will guide you in your research of your roles and will help you represent that person effectively, and the chairs will make your experience at the conference breathtaking.
        </p>
        <p>
          A little bit about myself, I am a freshman at Pacific Academy High School, who enjoys Model United Nations, Debate, Jazz, and reading Fire and Fury by Michael Wolff. I first stepped into the world of Model United Nations at a day conference like this one, and I ended up falling in love with it. As a result, I started to go to more conferences in Grade 8 and felt that Model United Nations was something I wanted to do more in high school. Other than MUN, I like to eat good food (and try and cook it with little success I may add), and I enjoy listening to music.
        </p>
        <p>
          The topic selected for this year’s HJCC is the Third Reich, where delegates will be transported into early 1930’s Germany and become members of the Reichstag to discuss topics which concern the German population in this year. The social issues surrounding post- World War 1 Germany is gargantuan and is a hard one to solve. However, we expect all delegates to participate and find a solution to the never ending social problems concerning at the current time. This topic/committee will test your abilities to think on the spot, effectively bring people in parliament together and try and make Germany great again.
        </p>
        <p class="no-indent">
          With that in mind, should you have any questions to Parker, Jason, Geneviève, Joanne, or I, please email: hcc@cydcmun.org
        </p>
        <p class="no-indent">
          We all hope to see you on March 31st at Douglas College!

        <h2>Historical Analysis</h2>
        <p>
          In order to truly understand the sentiments felt by the politicians, leaders, and citizens of Germany, one must look past towards World War 1.
        </p>
        <p>
          World War 1, dubbed the Great War or the “The War that will End All Wars”, was facilitated by the assassination of Archduke Franz Ferdinand of the Austro-Hungarian Empire in June 28 1914, who was assassinated by a Serbian Nationalist Student while the Archduke was trying to get to his reception at the Town Hall in a city in Serbia. This act infuriated the Austro-Hungarian Empire because it already had terrible diplomatic relations with Serbia, and a Serbian just killed the Empire’s heir to the throne. This caused the Austro-Hungarian Empire to declare war on Serbia in July 28, along with Germany, who declared its support for the Empire in July 5th. Although Germany has declared support for the Austrian Empire, Germany did have an ulterior motive in joining World War 1. Germany felt that The War would be a perfect opportunity to take advantage of and rise to regional hegemony over its rivals, France, Britain and Russia.  This caused Germany to declare war with Russia, France (also invading Belgium to invade France), and Germany’s actions lead to Britain declaring war on Germany. With that, the first ever World War would begin.
        </p>
        <p>
          Throughout The War, Germany was militarily at the top with its technological advancements such as tanks, Submarines (or known as U-boats), chemical weapons made Germany a military threat than ever before. Because of these advancements, it made the war bloodier, which meant more injured soldiers and casualties. Also, the advanced war capabilities made it possible for The War to involve other countries in other continents, such as USA, who joined The War because of the sinking of The Lusitania, which carried 2 US citizens, by a German U-boat. This made the Germans an unstoppable force in the eyes of others; however, it did not make them an unstoppable force in reality.

        <p>
          After many battles fought by the two conflicting groups, the fighting  ended on November 11 and Germany had lost the war. After the war, all countries involved in the war came together in Versailles, France where they discussed what to do next. The treaty proposed an ultimatum to Germany stating if Germany does not sign it, then the allies will go to war against Germany. Therefore, Germany had no choice but to sign the agreement, fueling resentment of the Reichstag at Germany. Through this discussion a few main things have been discussed and requirements were set. Firstly, Germany had to give up the land it occupied through World War 1, meaning that it had to give up: Belgium, Czechoslovakia, Poland and Austria-Hungary. Also Germany was to demobilize sufficient soldiers by 31 March 1920 to leave an army of no more than 100,000 men in a maximum of seven infantry and three cavalry divisions. This lead to the dismissal of many soldiers within the army, and diminished Germany’s military power severely. Finally, Germany had to pay reparations to France and Britain for the damage Germany had caused them during war. They also had to give up industrialized territories to pay France and Britain back. This only fueled resentment towards these countries, which takes us to the crisis at hand.

      <section id="crisis">
        <h2>The Crisis</h2>
        <p>
          There are couple of crisis directions that the committee could take, but these are the generic ideas and the main crisis shall be released on the day of.
        </p>
        <p>
          The year is 1932 and Germany is in its worse economic crisis it has ever seen so far. The mass amounts of debt Germany collected and the reparations it needed to pay from World War 1 created the need to print more money, which caused hyperinflation, making basic goods and services inaccessible to the majority of the population. Furthermore, this has resulted in many social issues within the German public, and people are infuriated about Germany having to pay reparations to Britain and France. For instance, people couldn’t find work during the recession, which resulted in mass unemployment. The effects of unemployment were devastating. While there were few shortages of food, millions found themselves without the means to obtain it. The children suffered worst, thousands dying from malnutrition and hunger-related diseases. Millions of industrial workers – who in 1928 had become the best-paid blue collar workers in Europe – spent a year or more in idleness. But the Great Depression affected all classes in Germany, not just the factory workers. Unemployment was high among white-collar workers and the professional classes. This was to the point where 60% of the graduating class in university, could not find a job. Therefore, one of the problems the Reichstag needs to solve is the glaring economic recession that is crippling every single person within the country. Depending on which party solves this problem more effectively, will determine which party gets elected in the next election the following year.
        </p>
        <p>
          Also, with 1932 being the year when the Reichstag elections happen, the two blocs should be mindful of each other and see which bloc will solve the current social issue at hand, and after the elections one bloc will have more power than the other, and the job of that bloc is to push their political agenda. However, the losing bloc should do everything it can to prevent the other bloc from achieving absolute power. Although this is the basic scheme of things, there are many other political, or military conflicts that may happen during the committee sessions.
        </p>
        <p>
          Finally, delegates should be mindful that any events that happen after 1932 is considered as fake; however, delegates can choose to act the same as the people of the past ( this is true for all scenarios).
        </p>
        <p>
          The second possible crisis is one that is extremely sensitive and if chosen should be handled with extreme delicacy. This is a crisis that takes place in 1935 where the nazi party is in majority control of the Reichstag and the Nazis are pushing their Nazi agenda ( kicking out the Jewish population, and demoting all political opposition) and the job of the Social Union is to prevent that from happening. The Social Union of Germany is a union created by the remainder of the parties to prevent the spread of Nazism to the rest of the German population. The reason why the Jewish population is being persecuted by the Nazis is because the Nazi’s believe that the Jews are hoarding all the wealth and is why the German population is suffering, and due to the severe social issues happening at the time, the majority of the people of Germany agree with the Nazis. Therefore, the Social Union should prioritize equality for all ( due to its Communist roots) and the Nazis should try and “deport” the Jews ( or the consequences for the Jewish population could be much worse but should be subtle to the public nor be too atrocious.).
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="parties">
        <h2>The Parties</h2>
        <p>
          In this specific version of the HJCC, delegates will have the option of choosing between two blocs, the Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party and the Social Union of Germany (Social Democratic Party, Centralists, and the Communists). Below will explain the ideologies of the parties and what position they take to the primary issue.
        </p>
        <h3>The Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party</h3>
        <p>
          The Nationalist Socialist German Workers Party (or the Nazi party) is a far right party which founded in 1920 and was a successor to its dissolved party the German Workers Party. The NSDAP is a party which disapproves of communism and was created to draw workers away from the idea of communism and into Völkisch Nationalism, which is a form of a populist movement that unites people on a single fear that needs to be solved. Members of this committee should focus on uniting the people on a single fear that needs to be eliminated to make Germany a prosperous nation again.
        </p>
        <h3>Social Democratic Party</h3>
        <p>
          The second party that the delegates can represent is the Social Democratic Party. Which is more of a liberal party that advocates for laws that help the people of Germany greatly. People in this committee should focus on the social welfare of the German people, and trying to bring unity. Therefore, both parties should work together as the Reichstag to help the people and create the Third Reich, which an era in 1933 when Germany was prosperous and strong. This Third Reich can be anything from a Social Democratic Party rule or a NSDAP rule.
        </p>
        <h3>Centralists</h3>
        <p>
          Along with the two major parties, there will be an option to represent a centrist politician, who is someone in the middle of the political spectrum. These centrist politicians are very important because they help balance out the political spectrum and bring an objective view towards many issues at hand. Therefore, delegates representing the centralists, should be wise in their decisions and go with the party that will guide Germany into a path of prosperity and strength.
        </p>
        <h3>Communists</h3>
        <p>
          The Communist Party of Germany have similar views as the views represented in the Communist Manifesto written by Karl Marx. This is because Germany has experienced its own Communist Revolution and the party is a direct stem from the people who started the revolution. Therefore, delegates should have communist ideals within their speeches and use those ideals to make Germany prosper once more.
        </p>
      </section>
      <section id="rop">
        <h2>Rules of Procedure</h2>
        <p>
          Unlike general MUN committees, crisis committees have a different set of Rules of Procedures that set them apart and make them extremely fun to participate in. Therefore, the paragraphs below explain two concepts within crisis committees that makes participating in one so enthralling.
        </p>
        <h3>Perpetual Moderated Caucus</h3>
        <p>
          The concept of a Perpetual Moderated Caucus is foreign to most delegates; however, this is just one of the things that makes a crisis committee unique. This means that delegates will take turns to speak at one minute intervals, and they do not need to motion for a moderated or unmoderated caucus. Occasionally, the dias would ask for any motions, or present a crisis update. When a directive is approved by the dias, it will be presented and voted upon by the committee, and once it has been done, the debate shall resume.
        </p>
        <h3>Directives</h3>
        <p>
          Essentially, directives are like miniature resolution papers, or what action your committee will take towards a crisis update. When sending up a directive, delegates can choose between sending up a public directive, or a private directive. A public directive is a directive that requires a simple majority vote and contains anything that should be discussed and approved by the committee. Private directives only require the approval of one delegate, the delegate writing the directive, but the effect of this directive is greatly limited by the delegates personal power. The outcome  of the private directives will be revealed to individual via a note from the dias. On that note, we expect the directives to be reasonable and achievable by the powers you have.
